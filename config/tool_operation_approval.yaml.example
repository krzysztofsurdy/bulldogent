# Tool operation approval configuration
#
# Controls which operations require human approval before execution.
# Only operations listed here require approval — unlisted operations execute immediately.
#
# Resolution order (most specific wins):
#   1. Project/entity override (projects.<KEY>)
#   2. Operation default (approval_group)
#
# Use ~ to explicitly exempt a project from an operation's default approval group.
